This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The project utilizes several machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and feature engineering methods to build a robust predictive model.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately predict the price of houses based on historical data. The dataset contains various features related to real estate, including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area in square feet, and location. The project explores different models to find the best-performing one for price prediction.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that help improve the model's performance.
- **Model Selection:** Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance through grid search and cross-validation.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate model accuracy.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `models/`: Saved models and related files for later use.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).
